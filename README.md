This is an app for localised buying and selling.

Users must register an account with an email address, username, and given name.

Logging in grants the user the ability to view posted ads of sellers or make their own posting to sell an item.

The seller lists an item with a cost, description, and associated photos of the item.

Sellers must also have venmo and paypal accounts set up for transactions.

In the description of the item, the seller is encouraged to include a neighborhood/area for the sale to take place in.

The buyer navigates the posts items by browsing through the shopping categories.

The buyer starts the transaction process by hitting the purchase button on the listings page, giving two options of paypal or venmo as methods for payment.

Buyers can view the sellers profile from the item description.

The user can view their own profile to manage settings and see their history (records of transactions).
